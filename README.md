🍏 FreshBites: Core Features Documentation
FreshBites is a Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) mobile application designed to connect independent food brands and local producers directly with consumers. This document outlines the core functional pillars that drive the user experience and business logic.

🛍️ 1. Smart Product Discovery & Catalog
The core shopping experience is designed to replicate the feel of a premium, curated farmer's market, optimized for mobile.

Farm-to-Table Transparency: Every product detail page includes the "Origin Story" (farm/brand profile, location, and sourcing practices) to build consumer trust.

Rich Media Displays: Support for high-resolution product imagery and short recipe/preparation videos.

Nutritional & Dietary Filtering: Deep filtering capabilities allowing users to shop by strict dietary needs (e.g., Vegan, Keto, Gluten-Free, Nut-Free) and certifications (e.g., USDA Organic, Fair Trade).

Curated Bundles & Meal Kits: Merchandising features that group complementary items together (e.g., "The Weekend BBQ Box" or "Organic Morning Juicing Kit") for easy one-click add-to-cart.

📦 2. Flexible Subscription Engine
D2C food models rely heavily on recurring revenue. The app features a robust "Subscribe & Save" mechanism.

Custom Delivery Cadence: Users can set deliveries to weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly depending on the item (e.g., weekly for fresh produce, monthly for pantry staples).

Subscription Management: A dedicated dashboard where users can easily skip a delivery, pause their subscription, or swap out specific items in their recurring box without contacting support.

Predictive Replenishment: Opt-in push notifications reminding users to reorder items based on their historical purchasing frequency.

🛒 3. Frictionless Checkout & Cart Management
Reducing cart abandonment is a priority through a streamlined, multi-option checkout process.

Dynamic Cart: Real-time calculation of taxes, shipping fees based on zip code, and subscription discounts.

Guest & Express Checkout: Integration with Apple Pay and Google Pay for one-tap checkout, alongside standard credit/debit options via Stripe.

Promo & Loyalty Integration: Seamless application of referral codes, seasonal discounts, and automatic redemption of loyalty points at checkout.

🚚 4. Real-Time Delivery & Logistics
Handling perishable goods requires exact logistics and clear communication with the consumer.

Delivery Slot Selection: Users can choose specific delivery windows to ensure they are home for perishable items.

Live Order Tracking: GPS integration showing the driver's location in real-time once the order is out for delivery.

Cold-Chain Notifications: Automated SMS and push notifications alerting the user when their box is packed, out for delivery, and safely dropped off (including photo confirmation).

🎁 5. Customer Loyalty & Retention
Features designed to increase Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and lower Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).

BitePoints Rewards: A gamified point system where users earn points for every dollar spent, writing reviews, or recycling delivery packaging.

Refer-a-Friend: Unique shareable links that grant both the referrer and the new user account credits upon the first successful order.

Personalized "Favorites" Aisle: An algorithm-driven section of the app that populates a user's most frequently bought items for rapid re-ordering.
